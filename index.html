  <p>My name is <strong>Julissa Morales</strong>.</p>

  <p>
    I have played <strong>squash</strong> since I was eleven, and it has been a big part of my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    More recently, I have started <em>exploring painting</em> after taking a course last semester that I enjoyed.
  </p>

  <p>
    As someone who <strong>loves learning new things</strong>, I created this website to explore new hobbies and to share my own progress along the way.
