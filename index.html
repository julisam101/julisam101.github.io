<body>
  <p>My name is Julissa Morales.</p>
  <p>I have played squash since I was eleven, and it has been a big part of my life.</p>
  <p>More recently, I have started exploring painting after taking a course last semester that I really enjoyed.</p>
  <p>As someone who loves learning new things, I created this website to inspire others to try new hobbies and to share my own progress along the way.</p>
