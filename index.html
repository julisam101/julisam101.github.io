  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14px;">My name is</span>
    <span style="color: darkblue; font-size: 20px;">Julissa Morales.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    I have played <b style="color: purple;">squash</b> since I was eleven, 
    and it has been a 
    <span style="font-size: 22px;">big</span> part of my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    More recently, I have started 
    <span style="color: darkgreen; font-size: 18px;">exploring</span> 
    painting after taking a course last semester that I 
    <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">enjoyed</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As someone who <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">loves</span> learning new things, 
    I created this website to <u>new hobbies</u> and to 
    <u>share my own <span style="color: hotpink; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">progress</span></u> 
    along the way.
